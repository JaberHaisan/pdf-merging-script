# pypdf-pdf-merging-script
Utility script for merging pdfs using pypdf.

Install pypdf through pip before using script: https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/

The script first gets the location of the pdf files from the user and then keeps taking pdf names until the user says to stop.
Finally it takes the name of the merged pdf file and creates it in the same location.

For all files, if the ".pdf" file extension is not provided the script will add it to the file name.
